## Web technology scanner based on wappalyzer
I was inspired by the quality of web technology discovery by the Wappalyzer app. 
What you are looking at now is a simple wrapper to scan a large list of web servers with JSON parsing for further viewing in Excel.

## How to use
0. Install [**Wappalyzer**](https://github.com/wappalyzer/wappalyzer) from the official repository
1. chmod 700 wapp_finder.sh
2. Set the wappalyzer variable (line 23)
3. Specify the list of targets for scanning in the hosts.txt file
